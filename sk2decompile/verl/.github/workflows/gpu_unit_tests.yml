# # Tests layout

# Each folder under tests/ corresponds to a test category for a sub-namespace in verl. For instance:
# - `tests/trainer` for testing functionality related to `verl/trainer`
# - `tests/models` for testing functionality related to `verl/models`
# - ...

# There are a few folders with `special_` prefix, created for special purposes:
# - `special_distributed`: unit tests that must run with multiple GPUs
# - `special_e2e`: end-to-end tests with training/generation scripts
# - `special_npu`: tests for NPUs
# - `special_sanity`: a suite of quick sanity tests
# - `special_standalone`: a set of test that are designed to run in dedicated environments

# Accelerators for tests 
# - By default tests are run with GPU available, except for the ones under `special_npu`, and any test script whose name ends with `on_cpu.py`.
# - For test scripts with `on_cpu.py` name suffix would be tested on CPU resources in linux environment.

# # Workflow layout

# All CI tests are configured by yaml files in `.github/workflows/`. Here's an overview of all test configs:
# 1. A list of always triggered CPU sanity tests: `check-pr-title.yml`, `secrets_scan.yml`, `check-pr-title,yml`, `pre-commit.yml`, `doc.yml`
# 2. Some heavy multi-GPU unit tests, such as `model.yml`, `vllm.yml`, `sgl.yml`
# 3. End-to-end tests: `e2e_*.yml`
# 4. Unit tests
#   - `cpu_unit_tests.yml`, run pytest on all scripts with file name pattern `tests/**/test_*_on_cpu.py`
#   - `gpu_unit_tests.yml`, run pytest on all scripts with file without the `on_cpu.py` suffix.
#   - Since cpu/gpu unit tests by default runs all tests under `tests`, please make sure tests are manually excluded in them when
#     - new workflow yaml is added to `.github/workflows`
#     - new tests are added to workflow mentioned in 2.
